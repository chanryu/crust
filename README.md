# Crust ðŸ¦€ðŸ”©

Crust is a C++ library that brings some of Rustâ€™s best conveniences to C++.

## Why

Because after using Rust, writing C++ sometimes feels like making a sandwich without the bread.

## How

While I proudly admit to being a Rust fanboy, Iâ€™m not trying to turn C++ into Rust. That would be both impossible (try adding a borrow checker to C++! ðŸ¤¯) and unnecessary.

Instead, Crust carefully ports Rust features that make practical sense in C++, enhancing the language without fighting it.

## What

Crust is still in its early days, and there's plenty more to come!

Right now, it includes:

### Mutex

`crust::Mutex` is designed to mimic Rustâ€™s `std::sync::Mutex` by binding the mutex with the data it protects. This prevents accidental misuse, such as accessing shared data without locking. Unlike `std::mutex` in C++, where the mutex and data are separate, `crust::Mutex<T>` ensures that locking grants scoped, safe access to `T`, just like Rustâ€™s `Mutex<T>`. It simplifies synchronization by encapsulating both the locking mechanism and the protected resource in a single entity.

Below is a side-by-side code comparison of `crust::Mutex` and `std::sync::Mutex`. The example is intentionally written to be as similar as possible to highlight their conceptual equivalence.
