# Crust ðŸ¦€ðŸ”©

Crust is a C++ library that brings some of Rustâ€™s best conveniences to C++.

## Why

Because after using Rust, writing C++ sometimes feels like making a sandwich without the bread.

## How

While I proudly admit to being a Rust fanboy, Iâ€™m not trying to turn C++ into Rust. That would be both impossible (try adding a borrow checker to C++! ðŸ¤¯) and unnecessary.

Instead, Crust carefully ports Rust features that make practical sense in C++, enhancing the language without fighting it.

## What

Crust is still in its early days, and there's plenty more to come!

Right now, it includes:
